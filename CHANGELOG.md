## [v1.0.1] ‚Äì 2025-04-29

### üöÄ Added
- **Geofence-based notification delivery**: Introduced logic to send notifications only after a user remains in a defined neighborhood for 5 minutes.
- **Notification expiration logic**: Added automatic expiration and removal of notifications 90 seconds after delivery if no user interaction occurs.
- **Unified event logging system**: Created `NotificationLogger.swift` to standardize the logging of all notification interactions (delivered, opened, missed, expired).
- **GeoJSON-based location handling**: Integrated `Neighborhoods-4.geojson` for defining neighborhood boundaries used in geofencing logic.

### üõ† Changed
- Refactored `AppDelegate.swift` and `LocationHandler.swift` to support randomized survey scheduling and location-based triggers using the updated logger.
- Updated local SQLite schema compatibility for tracking notification status and expiration timestamps.

### üêû Fixed
- Resolved an issue where notifications could be logged multiple times if the app restarted or if expiration logic failed.
- Fixed inconsistent behavior in tap vs. dismiss event tracking.
