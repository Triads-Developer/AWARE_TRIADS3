# üìò LOGGING.md ‚Äì Notification & Event Logging in AWARE

This document outlines the notification and event logging framework used in the **AWARE_TRIADS3** app. The app captures user interactions with notifications, logs contextual metadata, and transmits all logs to the AWARE server for secure analysis.

Logging plays a critical role in assessing **user engagement**, **survey response rates**, and **location-aware behavior patterns**.

---

## üß≠ Overview of the Logging System

- All events are logged using a centralized class: `NotificationLogger.swift`.
- Events are sent to: `AWAREEventLogger.shared()`.
- Data format: Flat JSON dictionary.
- Data syncing: Via `startSyncDB()` on the AWARE logger.
- Location-based notifications include GPS coordinates and neighborhood names.

## üìÇ Event Categories

| Category              | Description                                                  |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `random_notification` | Time-based scheduled surveys (4 per day √ó 7 days)            |
| `location_notification` | Triggered by dwelling ‚â•5 mins in predefined geo-polygons |
| `general_notification` | Default for uncategorized or test notifications             |

  "event_category": "random_notification",
  "data": {
    "event_type": "notification_opened",
    "identifier": "abc-123-xyz",
    "title": "Your next Survey is ready",
    "body": " ",
    "action": "Opened",
    "neighborhood": "Central West End",
    "url": "https://example.qualtrics.com/survey",
    "error": "",
    "notification_type": "RANDOM_SURVEY",
    "latitude": 38.6379,
    "longitude": -90.2628
  }
}
```

## üõ° Deduplication Mechanism

To prevent multiple log entries for the same event:

- A **composite key** is generated for each event:  
  ```swift
  let logKey = "\(eventCategory)_\(event)_\(identifier)"
  ```

- Two layers of filtering:
  1. **In-memory cache (`recentlyLoggedEvents`)**: auto-expires entries older than 15 minutes.
  2. **Persistent storage (`UserDefaults`)**: retains a set of previously logged keys (`logged_notification_keys`).

This ensures **each unique event is logged once**, even across app sessions.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Developer Tips

- Use `NotificationLogger.shared.logEventOnce(...)` for all tracked events.
- Use `.clearLoggedKeys()` to reset deduplication logs during development/testing.
- For debugging: logs also print to Xcode console with icons like `üì°`, `‚úÖ`, `‚ùóÔ∏è`.
